# Who am I?

I am Daniel O'Rourke, to put it simply, i'm just a programmer. I can program in Python, C++ (learning) and a little bit of HTML and CSS. I also work well with linux systems. I program with vscode on windwos for the majority of my time just because most of my programs are more suited for windows users, although I try to make my projects cross platform for both windows and linux, but i'm happy to use linux anytime.

I aspire to be a software enginneer when i'm older. Maybe even a full stack developer, but currently i'm still mastering my skills and expanding my knowledge.

Thanks for reading!
